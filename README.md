## My process
I really did follow along a youtube tutorial 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grids

### What I learned

I learned to use the BEM methodology:
```html
<div class="card__text">
    <h2 class="card__heading">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
    <p class="card__detail">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
    </p>
</div>
```

The is() function: 
```css
.attribution__link:is(:hover, :focus-within)
```

And :focus-within
```css
.attribution__link:is(:hover, :focus-within) {
    color: rgb(34, 195, 191);
}
```

### Continued development

The terms I'd love to use and remember more on most projects are:
- BEM
- CSS functions 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdmeiXWRxcY) - This helped me because the tutorial was easy to follow along and well explaines.
